# Feature Specification: RapidAI Website Baseline Reference

**Feature Branch**: `001-codebase-baseline-reference`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "codebase baseline reference"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a product stakeholder, I want a single document that captures how the existing RapidAI marketing website and CMS operate today so that future feature work can reference authoritative behaviors, content flows, and constraints.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current production-like codebase (`index.html`, `script.js`, `content/`, `translations/`), **When** a contributor reviews this baseline, **Then** they can enumerate all dynamic sections, data sources, and locale behaviors without opening the code.
2. **Given** the Netlify/Decap CMS integration, **When** reviewing OAuth or content governance, **Then** the reference highlights required endpoints (`netlify/functions/oauth.js`) and CMS entry points (`admin/index.html`, `admin/minimal-cms.html`).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a locale-specific content file is missing? Baseline must document the English fallback behavior implemented in `script.js` loaders.
- How does the system behave if OAuth credentials are unavailable? Baseline should record the PKCE fallback and diagnostic URLs in `logs/` and `netlify/functions/oauth.js` to ensure future work preserves access.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Baseline documentation MUST list every CMS-managed content collection under `content/` with locale coverage (EN/ES/FR) and associated front-end loaders in `script.js`.
- **FR-002**: Baseline documentation MUST describe the localization flow (translation JSON files, loading order, fallback logic) and any known gaps (e.g., Spanish tuteo requirement).
- **FR-003**: Baseline documentation MUST outline authentication architecture (PKCE OAuth endpoints, Netlify Functions, CMS manual init) and reference diagnostic URLs.
- **FR-004**: Baseline documentation MUST capture deployment and tooling expectations (Netlify main branch deploys, `npm run test:translations`, manifest generation scripts).
- **FR-005**: Baseline documentation MUST highlight accessibility and UX patterns already implemented (loading/empty states, progressive enhancement) to guide future work.

*Open clarifications:*
- **FR-006**: Baseline SHOULD document any outstanding translation debt ([NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm remaining inconsistent keys across `translations/es.json`]).
- **FR-007**: Baseline SHOULD note performance targets or monitoring KPIs ([NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm actual production thresholds vs. roadmap in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`]).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Manifests**: JSON files (e.g., `content/services/manifest.json`, `content/testimonials/manifest.json`) listing slugs consumed by `script.js` loaders to fetch per-locale markdown/JSON.
- **OAuth Session**: PKCE flow artifacts stored via secure cookies and localStorage tokens as orchestrated by `netlify/functions/oauth.js` and `admin/index.html`.
