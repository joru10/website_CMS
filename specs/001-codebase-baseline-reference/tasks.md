# Tasks: RapidAI Website Baseline Reference

**Input**: Documentation deliverables derived from spec, plan, research, and data model.
**Prerequisites**: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Review spec.md and plan.md for remaining TODOs.
2. Generate documentation tasks covering localization, OAuth, deployment, accessibility.
3. Ensure each task references the exact target file.
4. Identify parallelizable items (separate files) and mark [P].
5. Produce dependency notes and validation checklist.
```

## Phase 3.1: Documentation Setup
- [ ] T001 Confirm research inventory completeness in `research.md`.
- [ ] T002 [P] Capture content manifest entities in `data-model.md`.
- [ ] T003 [P] Describe OAuth flow and diagnostics in `research.md`.

## Phase 3.2: Reference Artifacts
- [ ] T004 [P] Author quickstart validation steps in `quickstart.md`.
- [ ] T005 Summarize deployment/tooling checklist in `research.md`.
- [ ] T006 Document accessibility & UX patterns in `research.md`.

## Phase 3.3: Outstanding Clarifications
- [ ] T007 Record translation debt TODOs in `research.md`.
- [ ] T008 Highlight performance KPI gaps in `research.md`.

## Dependencies
- **T001** precedes all other tasks (ensures research foundation).
- **T002** and **T004** can proceed in parallel once **T001** completes.
- **T005-T008** depend on research findings outlined in **T001**.

## Parallel Example
```
Execute T002 (data-model.md) and T004 (quickstart.md) simultaneously since they touch distinct files.
```

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Research covers localization, OAuth, deployment, accessibility, and TODOs.
- [ ] Data model enumerates each content/entity group.
- [ ] Quickstart instructs how to consume baseline docs and validate setup.
- [ ] Outstanding clarifications recorded for follow-up.
