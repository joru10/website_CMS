# Feature Specification: ACE Autopilot Content Engine

**Feature Branch**: `002-ace-autopilot-content`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ACE autopilot content engine"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the RapidAI content lead, I want an autopilot engine that assembles daily and weekly multilingual content packages (News Digest, Blog Insight, Use-Case Spotlight) so we can grow leads and social reach without manually drafting every piece.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a weekday morning at 07:00 CET, **When** the News Digest pipeline completes, **Then** the reviewer dashboard presents 4‚Äì8 curated items (with inline add/remove/reorder controls, SME why-it-matters copy, and ‚â•2 corroborating links each) ready for approval and pre-translated into ES/FR.
2. **Given** a Friday 16:00 CET candidate review session, **When** the Blog Insight scorer evaluates the prior week‚Äôs news pool, **Then** the reviewer sees 3‚Äì5 candidates with business-value scores ‚â•65, outlines, and suggested search terms, and can approve one for drafting.
3. **Given** a Monday 09:00 CET Use-Case Spotlight review, **When** the system proposes 2‚Äì3 candidates combining seed news and manual suggestions, **Then** the reviewer can approve one with ROI framing to trigger full drafts and translations by Tuesday 16:00 CET.
4. **Given** any track‚Äôs draft passes QA gates, **When** the reviewer approves and schedules publication, **Then** the system creates a Git PR with type-specific front-matter (including candidate scores/seed IDs), JSON-LD, assets, RSS entries, and LinkedIn copy queued for Netlify deployment.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when sources fail or provide duplicate stories? The engine must dedupe items, pull from overflow RSS caches, and invite manual inserts before promoting drafts.
- How does the system behave when Blog/Use-Case candidate scores fall below thresholds? The reviewer is notified with fallback suggestions (extended window, manual seed) and no auto-draft occurs until approval.
- What if translation quality drops below configured confidence? The reviewer must receive warnings with per-segment QE scores; drafts stay in "QA-passed" but blocked from scheduling.
- How should the system respond if candidate traceability (seed news IDs) is missing? Publishing must be blocked until provenance links are re-established.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The engine MUST deliver News Digest drafts Monday‚ÄìFriday with 4‚Äì8 items sourced from news.smol.ai, configured RSS feeds, and optional manual inserts, each containing "what happened", "why it matters", and ‚â•2 corroborating links.
- **FR-002**: The engine MUST surface Blog Insight candidates weekly (3‚Äì5 options with Business-Value Score ‚â•65) and generate approved drafts following the BI template with internal links to related News/Use-Case content.
- **FR-003**: The engine MUST surface Use-Case Spotlight candidates weekly (2‚Äì3 options with Business-Value Score ‚â•60) incorporating ROI framing, manual suggestions, and publish selected drafts following the US template.
- **FR-004**: All tracks MUST enforce track-specific workflows (candidate pool, manual insert step, state transitions) and allow reviewers to approve, hold, or edit items through the UI.
- **FR-005**: Quality gates MUST include readability ‚â•60, link health, duplicate detection across recent corpus, translation QE ‚â•0.7, schema validation (NewsArticle/BlogPosting/CaseStudy), and advisory flagging for unsupported claims.
- **FR-006**: Publishing MUST create Git PRs containing EN/ES/FR Markdown with type-aware front-matter (`track_meta` fields, candidate scores, seed IDs), JSON-LD snippets, assets, RSS updates, and LinkedIn share copy.
- **FR-007**: All published artifacts MUST be indexed into the RAG store with track tags and provenance for future scoring and internal link suggestions.
- **FR-008**: The reviewer dashboard MUST provide track-specific views (News board with manual insert, Blog/Use-Case candidate tables with scores and actions) and reflect state transitions in real time.

*Open clarifications:*
- **FR-009**: Deployment model for reviewer UI and orchestration services [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm hosting preference‚Äîlocal docker vs managed environment].
- **FR-010**: Final RSS/search allowlist and manual seed workflows [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pending content team confirmation].
- **FR-011**: Branding assets and typography for hero/banner generator [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: design team input required].
- **FR-012**: Whether BI/US drafts should support MDX components (charts/diagrams) in addition to Markdown [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Jobs**: Scheduled runs describing cadence, track (news/blog/use-case), target times, and states.
- **Candidate Pool**: Ranked list of potential Blog/Use-Case topics with business-value scores, seed news IDs, and reviewer decisions.
- **Draft Packages**: Bundles of outlines, full drafts, track templates, translations, quality metrics, and provenance metadata.
- **Manual Insert Records**: Reviewer-submitted News items with source metadata, priority, and inclusion status.
- **Source Library**: Catalog of ingestion connectors, feeds, cached articles, dedupe fingerprints, and search snapshots.
- **Review Queue**: Track-specific UI states, manual insert buffers, candidate selection logs.
- **Publishing Artifacts**: Git PR metadata, RSS entries, LinkedIn copy, schema JSON, asset references, audit logs.
