# Feature Specification: ACE Autopilot Content Engine

**Feature Branch**: `002-ace-autopilot-content`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ACE autopilot content engine"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the RapidAI content lead, I want an autopilot engine that assembles daily and weekly multilingual content packages (News Digest, Blog Insight, Use-Case Spotlight) so we can grow leads and social reach without manually drafting every piece.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a weekday morning at 07:00 CET, **When** the system finishes its News Digest run, **Then** a human reviewer sees a ready-to-approve English draft with ‚â•4 curated items, citations, and SME relevance notes along with pending translations for ES/FR.
2. **Given** a scheduled Blog Insight slot, **When** the planner selects a trend from recent digests, **Then** the engine presents a 1,000‚Äì1,500 word draft following the BI template with action items and footnotes.
3. **Given** reviewer approval of any content type, **When** the publish action is triggered, **Then** the site receives Markdown files (EN/ES/FR) via Git PR with front-matter, SEO metadata, JSON-LD, assets, and RSS/LinkedIn payloads ready.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when sources fail or provide duplicate stories? The engine must dedupe items and fall back to alternate feeds before surfacing drafts.
- How does the system behave if readability, fact-check, or QE scores fail thresholds? Drafts remain in "review" state with flagged issues and do not advance to publishing until resolved.
- What if translation quality drops below configured confidence? The reviewer must receive warnings and the content remains pending.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The engine MUST generate News Digest drafts Monday‚ÄìFriday with 4‚Äì8 curated items, each containing summary, SME relevance, and ‚â•2 cited sources.
- **FR-002**: The engine MUST produce Blog Insights and Use-Case Spotlights on the defined cadence, adhering to the specified section templates and word counts.
- **FR-003**: All drafts MUST pass governance gates (fact-check, readability ‚â•60, link health, duplicate detection, toxicity skim) before they can enter human review.
- **FR-004**: Approved content MUST be published via Git PR containing Markdown (EN/ES/FR), front-matter, SEO metadata, schema blocks, assets, and RSS/LinkedIn payloads.
- **FR-005**: A reviewer dashboard MUST expose pending items, blockers, schedules, and allow approve/schedule/edit actions.
- **FR-006**: All published content MUST be indexed into the RAG store for future retrieval and internal linking suggestions.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST maintain audit logs covering ingestion sources, decision scores, reviewer actions, and publishing outcomes.

*Open clarifications:*
- **FR-008**: Deployment model for reviewer UI and orchestration services [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm hosting preference‚Äîlocal docker vs managed environment].
- **FR-009**: Final list of approved RSS feeds and search endpoints [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pending content team confirmation].
- **FR-010**: Branding assets for hero/banner generator [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm colors/fonts or provide defaults].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Jobs**: Scheduled runs describing cadence, type (ND/BI/US), target publish time, and status (draft/review/approved/scheduled/published).
- **Draft Packages**: Bundles of outlines, full drafts, citations, assets, SEO metadata, translations, and quality gate metrics per content type.
- **Source Library**: Catalog of ingestion connectors, feeds, cached articles, and dedupe fingerprints.
- **Review Queue**: Human-facing backlog with approvals, comments, and scheduling actions.
- **Publishing Artifacts**: Git PR metadata, RSS entries, LinkedIn copy, schema JSON, asset references, and audit logs.
