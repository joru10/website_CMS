# Cascade Output Mirror

This file mirrors key assistant outputs so you can copy from your editor while chat copy/paste is blocked.

## Links
- Production Admin (cache-busted): https://comfy-panda-0d488a.netlify.app/admin/index.html?v=20250808-3#/
- Local Admin (cache-busted): http://127.0.0.1:52841/admin/index.html?v=20250808-3#/

## What to check in the browser console
- "Decap inline config summary" with:
  - dupLocales: []
  - dupCollections: []
- "Initializing Decap CMS with inline config (load_config_file=false)"
- "CMS.getConfig() snapshot …"

If you see "Decap CMS: using root /config.yml for local dev", you’re on stale HTML. Do a hard refresh on the exact URL above (or Incognito), then recheck.

## Current CMS status
- Stray admin/config.pepayml removed.
- Inline-only config enforced in `admin/index.html` (no external config merge).
- Diagnostics added; cache-busting (+ no-cache headers in `netlify.toml`).
- Changes pushed to `main`.

## Next steps
- Open production Admin with cache-busted URL above; verify console messages.
- If issues persist, paste console output into `input/from_user.md` (see below), or ask me to capture logs automatically and write them into `logs/`.
